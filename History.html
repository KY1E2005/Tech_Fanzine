        <p class="subtext">The evolution of mobile phones is a fascinating journey that spans several decades, 
            beginning with the bulky and cumbersome devices of the <b>1980s</b> to the ultra-sleek and powerful smartphones we use today. In the early days, mobile phones were large, expensive, and primarily used by businesses or individuals who could afford the luxury.</p>
        <p class="subtext">By the <b>2000s</b>, mobile phones became even more sophisticated with the introduction of color screens, 
            polyphonic ringtones, cameras, and internet browsing capabilities. The emergence of smartphones in the mid-2000s, with devices like the BlackBerry and the first iPhone, marked a major shift in mobile technology. Phones were no longer just for making calls; they became personal digital assistants (PDAs), music players, and handheld computers.</p>

        <div class="panel-content">
            <p>The Nokia 3310, a durable and iconic mobile phone, was announced on September 1, 2000, and released in the fourth quarter of that year. It replaced the popular Nokia 3210 and quickly became one of the most successful phones in history, with over 126 million units sold worldwide.
                The 3310 was renowned for its durability, long battery life, and customizable features. Despite its simplicity, the 3310 gained a cult following and became a symbol of the early 2000s mobile era.
            <br><br>
            It was also the first mobile phone with a unique chat function, which allows users to have a conversation, similar to the chat services on the Internet, with other 3310 owners just by using short messages. This seems obvious now, but was revolutionary at the time. The call logs were able to record the ten most recent missed and received calls, and the last twenty dialled calls. A set of call timers recorded the duration of calls as well as cumulative totals.
        <br><br>
        The Nokia 3310 was also an incredibly successful mobile phone with 126 million being sold.</p>

            <p>The Samsung S300 was a slim and stylish mobile phone released in 2002. It was one of the first phones to feature a color screen, and it also had a built-in camera, MP3 player, and Bluetooth connectivity. The S300 was a popular choice among consumers who wanted a phone with a sleek design and advanced features. Despite its success, the S300 was eventually overshadowed by newer models with even more advanced features. However, it remains a significant milestone in the history of mobile phones, as one of the first devices to offer a combination of style, functionality, and cutting-edge technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-content">
            <p>The Motorola Razr V3, a sleek and iconic flip phone, was released in 2004 and quickly became one of the most popular mobile devices of its time. The Razr V3 boasted a high-resolution external display, a built-in camera, and advanced features such as Bluetooth connectivity and MP3 playback. It's popularity was fueled by its unique design, which set it apart from other phones on the market. Development of the V3 started in July 2003 with Motorola aiming to create a very skinny phone. In the United States the V3 (and its variants) was the most popular cell phone in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and remained best-selling until November 2008.
                <br><br>
                As a result of Motorola’s comprehensive development processes, only phones which demonstrated significant margin would make it onto the road map. That required a minimum volume of three million phones. At the initial meetings of the committee which made the decisions to progress products the Razor (with the "o" at the time) was proposed with a volume of 800,000 units. On this basis it should have been rejected. Not only was the volume too low, it was also very hard to make. The antenna was an engineering challenge and the external screen needed to be monochrome if it wasn't going to bulge out. The phone’s design relied on the strength of the glass screen for structural integrity. The etched keypad could only be made by one supplier and in limited quantities.
                <br><br>
                The phone also came into the ‘portfolio meeting’ with no operator commitment, without adhering to any consumer or carrier segmentation guidelines and at a crazy price point of $1,000. It was later revealed that even the volume projection was false, the team building Razor estimated 300,000 units. Under the Motorola process it should have been kicked into touch at that first portfolio meeting.
                That it didn't was a tribute to the vision of two men: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113224571069300281"><u>Geoffrey Frost</u></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerjellicoe/"><u>Roger Jellicoe</u></a>.

            <p>The Sony Ericsson W800, a music-centric mobile phone, was released in March 2, 2005 and quickly gained popularity among music enthusiasts. It was one of the first phones to feature a dedicated music player and a Walkman logo, making it a must-have for those who wanted to carry their entire music library with them. The W800 boasted a high-quality audio player, a large internal memory for storing music files, and a microSD card slot for expanding storage. It also had a built-in FM radio and Bluetooth connectivity for wireless music streaming. The W800 was a significant milestone in the history of mobile phones, as it demonstrated the potential for smartphones to become more than just communication devices.

            <br><br>
            Announced by Sony Ericsson CEO, Miles Flint, in a windy marquee tent on the beach at Cannes, France where the annual 3GSM World Congress event was being held, it was the first product to combine a mobile phone, a high-quality digital music player and a two-megapixel camera.</p>
